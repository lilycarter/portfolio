          <h3>Post Graduate Diploma in Digital Business</h3>
          <p>I am beginning a Post Graduate Diploma in Digital Business via correspondance at The University of Waikato in March 2020. This study will be part time as I continue to work full time and will take me approximately 1.5 years to complete. I chose this course in particular as it combined elements of both business and I.T that greatly interest me. </p>
